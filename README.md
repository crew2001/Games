# Games

## Overview

This is a repo that I have setup for personal game development that I have done outside of my physics work. The aim of the project is to show my interest in coding, and also to help develop my experience in C++ 
and Python. I hope to update this repo as I go along making simple games in these two languages, with various different components. 

## Structure

The repo is structured such that each game is in a separate folder, and that each of the folders can be run as it's own self contained project. This means that with C++ projects, all the information 
about the game will be stored in the folder for that game (e.g with all source code and CMakeLists.txt within). With the python projects I'll have a requirements.txt file with the libraries needed for the 
game to run. 

## Contents

* Tic-tac-toe-py - An implementation of the minimax algorithm to solve the game of tic-tac-toe in python, with the game being played in the terminal

* snake-cpp - A simple C++ snake game, with the snake class controlling the snake and the production of the food, and SDL2 library used in main.cpp.

### Work in progress

* pong-py - A fun python AI for the game pong. This uses the neat-python package to implement an interesting AI method inspired by natural selection.
